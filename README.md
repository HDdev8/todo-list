# Todo List

**Link to project:** (work in progress)

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Webpack

I use mostly CSS Grid and a little Flexbox for the layout. 

## Optimizations:

Earlier projects do what they're supposed to do, but I wasn't aware of SOLID principles. For this project, I'm using Factory Functions, learning more about SOLID principles, and trying to incorporate them. 

## Lessons Learned:

I've learned the basics of Webpack.
