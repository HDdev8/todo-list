# Todo List

**Link to project:** https://hddev8.github.io/todo-list/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Webpack

I use mostly CSS Grid for the layout. Projects and Todos are added to arrays, which are then stored in localStorage.

## Optimizations:

I loosely tried to implement an MVC pattern, as well as follow SOLID principles. As I move on to further projects, I'm definitely trying to have cleaner code. For example, I think some of my functions could be better abstracted.

## Lessons Learned:

By making this project, I learned more about using Webpack. I also learned more about MVC, MVVM, and other design patterns. I was excited to use localStorage for the first time! I gained a better understanding of how and why not to have tightly coupled code. I learned more about clean code and how much I would like to improve.
